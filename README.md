Zomato Data Analysis

This project analyzes Zomato's dataset to uncover insights into restaurant preferences, pricing, and customer behavior. The analysis leverages Python and various data visualization libraries to answer key questions about the data.

## Project Overview

This project uses the following Python libraries:
- **Numpy**: Efficient computation with Numpy arrays.
- **Matplotlib**: Creating high-quality plots, charts, and histograms.
- **Pandas**: Simplifying data loading and manipulation.
- **Seaborn**: Creating visually appealing statistical graphics.

## Key Questions Addressed

1. Do more restaurants offer online delivery compared to offline services?
2. Which types of restaurants are the most favored by the general public?
3. What price range is preferred by couples for their dinner at restaurants?

## Steps Followed

1. **Importing Libraries**: Necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
2. **Creating the Data Frame**: Loading the Zomato dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Converting data types, handling missing values, and transforming columns.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Examining the presence of null values.
   - Visualizing types of restaurants.
   - Summarizing votes for different restaurant types.
   - Identifying the restaurant with the maximum votes.
   - Comparing online vs offline order preferences.
   - Analyzing rating distribution and cost preferences.

## Key Findings

- **Restaurant Types**: Dining restaurants are the most common and preferred type.
- **Online Orders**: Majority of restaurants do not accept online orders, but cafes primarily receive online orders.
- **Ratings**: Online orders tend to receive higher ratings compared to offline orders.
- **Cost Preferences**: Most couples prefer restaurants with an approximate cost of 300 rupees for two people.
